<h2 class="nobreak" id="PARK_PEARLS">PARK PEARLS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the cottage, a stranger is hailed with sharp
palpable hostility, followed by a guttural sentence
inwardly spoken. The watchdog pours out his
durable qualities on the intruder’s ear. To prevent
any misunderstanding, he tells, most forcibly,
of the consequences of a nearer approach.
As the inmates of the hamlet are thus warned,
an unknown face gazes on him, waiting at the
wicket. I love the creature’s voice. It sounds of a
home, although not mine. It hints of a domestic
circle with chubby bairns, little dumpy arms, tiny
prattling feet, dirty faces—as all children have
if left to their own sweet will—children of the
woods and parks, little rural arabs—the human
world in miniature uncontrolled. The barking
is incessant. A mellow voice spreads over the
grassy lawns; on the pensive air, a hollow
metallic ringing is carried out, eddying as tiny
wavelets to the shore of a tiny pool—the music
of an echo, touching the high towers of the
mansion-house, rebounding to the forest edge—clear,
fine, and pleasing. The winter sunny rays
moisten the crust by the gateway, and the earth
seems saturated by a shower which fell days ago—a
shower of snow. Around the open glade, a
stately circle of beech and fir trees marks the
park’s outline. The day is cold and damp; the
seasons hang in the balance.</p>

<p>In summer here, I know a tree whereon the
cushat builds, a tree of fir. On the green soft
cushion around its base the children gather
needles and pins for youthful household purposes—age
reflected in infancy. These trees are
honestly Scotch, riveted to the soil; the nettle
and the thistle lower in the scale. Around the
wood-pigeons’ abode, mighty beeches extend their
branches, and sycamores shelter the approach—trees
born of ancestral days, veterans of the
forest; and at eventide, when the sun is warm,
carrying its fire-flame westwards, the low Coo,
coo! familiarly resounds over the park—a
plaintive moaning from the tree-top. The lark
from the mossy meadow tells his tale of love and
devotion, going high above the forest shadows,
revelling in the ether, shouting vocally in the sky,
making the aërial hall ring with its joyous out-pourings—a
musical day-star, a pearl from earth
and the clod paying homage at the footstool of
light.</p>

<p>Over the emerald ground-work, a rook is seen;
when the wind is high, he courts the lee-side of
the forest, and hugs the bushes on the border,
passing like a mighty rushing blast, causing the
dead leaf to swirl on the grass. Atop the fence
circling the copse, the magpie sits with piratical
flashes in his eye, brooding over the stratagem
required for further business. Down to the field
he goes, and over the meadow-land on strong
wing, tail floating gaily in the breeze; a gem,
a pearl, a bird of surpassing beauty, up to the
fir-trees, chattering harshly, loudly, defiantly.
A continuous warble, an entertaining exhibition
of voice-power on the part of the hedge-sparrow,
enlivens the bushes under the shadow of the
beeches; its capabilities of a very high order—a
low, sweet, liquid song. In a meditating mood
it sits; with an inquisitive air it looks for food
under the stems. Its little nest is cosy; its
contents four blue turquoises set in a brown
environment.</p>

<p>Cuck-oo, cuck-oo! What a mystic sound! a
half-human, a legendary echo, a resemblance
half-bird, half-mammal expression; a source of
infinite conjecture, a perfume from an unseen
flower. There it sits, a brown, dark, spotted-like
creature, with long arrow-like body, lengthy
ocean-steamer-formed bird, a true migrant, a
sailor on the winds, a voyager across the oceans;
an outlaw, a bohemian, living by the way, dropping
its egg in the nest of some absent one, leaving
the care of its offspring to another; an ichneumon
in feathers. Cuck-oo, cuck-oo! The sound comes
from the bushes out there. No! There he
sits still, not knowing he is observed. Strange
bird, dweller in eternal summer climes, hater of
northern blasts; and as you reflect, he is gone
down the grove to seek his mate.</p>

<p>Following each other, wailing, calling, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">{562}</span>
lapwings dive, rise, and scream again, flapping
their rounded paddles—brilliant pearls of colour
touched by the sunlight. What hilarity; what
gestures they cut over the park, down the slope,
and across the fields. Joyful birds, birds of the
earth and the fullness thereof. The cheerful
merry notes come on the breeze, and contain a
wildness, a free, piquant taste of nature’s highways.
In spring, the notes bring with them the
milkboy’s song and the ploughman’s whistle.
You feel the air refreshed; a balminess fills the
glade, seeks between the tree arms, clusters round
the hedge, reassuring the crocus and the primrose.
Your heart goes out to meet the bird, even be
it unseen, as if photographed on the mind; the
rural scene within a certain range springs before
the imagination, called up afresh. All nature
claps its hands in pride and ecstasy.</p>

<p>With a hurried Cha, cha, cha, cha! the blackbird
leaves the stone wall—a cock-bird, black as
jet—to attend his lady on the park’s surface. A
rollicking sprightliness characterises his movements;
his tone is sharp, full of intricacies, hard
to interpret. In autumn, when the nests are
empty, how delightful to walk through the
copse—a clump of dwarfed trees, everything in
repose. The nests, the homes, the beds of the
departed little ones, rest there between the forks
and amongst the benty undergrowth, remnants of
blithe mirth-making and droll expressions. A
few feathers—vivid remembrance of garments—the
broken twigs and sere leaves are toys. Singing
now is in silvery strains; before, it was
golden; now restricted in its compass and its
range.</p>

<p>The pheasant from the cover skulks hastily
away, and in the sun shines as a pearl of great
price. His ruby head he cannot hide—it is too
lovely. It sets off as a coronet his kingly robes.
‘Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.’ An
irresistible habit attends the luckless bird; he
peers from the herbage, and the sun catches the
treacherous colours, denouncing the retreat of
this majestic park glory. There is an unspeakable
mellowness. Insect and bird, both are loth
to frolic; they are not now so fond of being seen,
eluding the watchful eye; contented trills are
all that is now heard. Yellow, full-eared cornfields,
charged with the honey of a season, like
soldiers, laden with booty, now ‘pile their arms’
in squares and companies over the harvest battle-field.</p>

<p>With the stillness of a mid-day in the park, at
that moment when even the birds are gone, the
insect world vanished, there is a sudden seeming
pause. The daisy and the clover say it is the
meridian, the exact moment when the dial casts
no side shadow. It resembles the dinner-hour,
the din and rattle hushed for a time. When
the cuckoos meet here in the gushing summer
day, when the down-pouring of the golden rays
from the clear sky parches the pebbly brook,
and curls up the grass of the park, then the
combination of pride, blitheness, and mid-day
fervour of breezes modified, refined by the park
trees, disperse in the quiet inclosure, and mingling
in space with the warm air, vanish, as it
were, in an unanswerable manner.</p>

<p>Kittiwakes from the rocky heights wander, by
the aid of their beautiful wings, over the park
round the copse, circling, screaming with angry
voice, with a majesty, an aristocratic air, no
flurried haste. These wings are seasoned by the
salt of the ocean. They move over the reefs,
the shoals, the surface-swells of the landscape;
but their gaze pierces not the crest of the earth,
but is thrown back tauntingly, while their eyes
search pleadingly. These water-washed pearls
rest in twos and threes, white dots on the carpet
of green. The daisy, dandelion, clover, and the
tints of many grasses, cut out lovely patterns
before your eyes; the primrose makes a golden
margin, the bushes raise the edge. In the
language of flowers, the surface holds communion.
Above the long rank growth on the
ditch-side, the sorrel loves to dwell, and thistles
keep watch over their lowly neighbours.</p>

<p>A transient glimpse of a pretty bird in the
depths of the bushes rivets the attention—a
redstart!—jerky, flirting beauty. This tangled
undergrowth seems a fit habitation only for the
badger, or a likely cover for the fox. That
admixture of ruby and turquoise might well
adorn the scrupulously trimmed lawn before
the mansion-house. Why stay in such a sequestered
nook? You are an uncommon friend.
Right glad am I to make the acquaintance of
such as you, even here. How restless you
wander along the bough, your shrill note doubtless
being apprehensive of danger, away under
the bushes without a parting word. A robin
fills the place—that hero of many a tale, that
picture-painted creature evolved from the reddish-tinted
egg shells. His family meet him on the
broom that overhangs the bank. The earthwork
has fallen, disclosing the boughs that were once
underground, appearing now like strong cables
from ship to anchor. Its home is there, behind
the rootlet, and between that and the earthen
wall. At evening, puffed up, ball-formed, it
sits challenging a robin not far off in vocal
speech, a ruby spot, a blood-stained front without
a scar. The notes remind you of olden days.
Something is gone, is awanting; a vagueness
immeasurable borders the song. There is a
want, although he sings in language liquid and
clear. It is in harmony with the half-sleeping
water babbling through the grasses. He is a
wild Red Indian, sighing, jerking, laughing,
smiling at the weather of the seasons.</p>

<p>Two, three! Keep still; there go the rabbits.
Move your foot amongst those dead leaves—magic,
they are gone! Thud, thud! be it anger, fear, or
defiance. Thud! the very earth vibrates in harmony
with the animals’ spirit. Over the entrance,
on the tree-roots grow long variegated lines of
stainless white vegetation—whiter under there,
against the earth—a soft quartz in a soft rock.
That sapling is dead, nipped in its youth. Its
leaves are golden, its virgin beauty was green. All
other trees are in their native garb. In its fall,
its dying agony, its roots wrenched from the soil,
the earth still adhering; it had groaning, fallen,
clenched its comrade; and now petrified, its
arms are rigid, death-like. The bunnies burrow
under the shelter of the upturned sapling; but
otherwise its history is wrapped in unconcern.
Only the bee, that in its flight catches the reddish
glow, and halts to know the cause. The common
blue butterfly, in its diurnal flight over the park
in search of sweets, at times erects its wings,
there exhibiting the rows of matchless pearls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">{563}</span>
imprinted on the border of its garment. The
wren leaves not the tree in its misfortune, but
twits its plaintive miniature trill from under
the withered leaves and débris swept against its
surface, accumulating with every fresh breeze.</p>

<p>Again the participating musical stumble of
the blackbird comes from the tree-branch on
the copse margin—a male voice, a bass, with
variations of chattering fluency. Late insects
linger at the outskirts, and roam the extent of
the park. The insect hum rises from the herbage
here and there; a bee, trapped by the spider’s
snare, hums, buzzing vengeance on the fisher
casting his silken net there. In the bushes, a
slight fluttering—a leaf floats unheard to the
ground, to increase the mouldy earth. The repose
is broken again and again—droning beetles, and
the tingling flight of the moths fluttering around
the willows at the burn. The tawny owls hoot,
throwing a weird enchantment on things adjacent,
their muffled, softened wings carrying them from
view along the forest edge. A solitary starry
pearl, a snowdrop of the heavens, bursts the crust
of the empyrean—then it is night.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Nora and the doctor reached the door of
Orange Grove, they found Edward Hawthorn
waiting to receive them, and the servants already
busy trying to remove as far as possible the signs
of the wreck so lately effected by the wild rioters.
Several neighbouring planters, who had come
down from the hills above, stood in armed groups
around the gate; and a few mounted black constables,
hastily summoned to the spot by the fire,
were helping to extinguish the smouldering ashes.
Only Delgado’s dead body lay untouched upon
the sofa, stiff and motionless, for not one of the
negroes dare venture to set hands upon it; and
in the room within, Marian sat still, looking
anxiously at Harry Noel’s pallid face and livid
eyelids, and his bloodstained shirt, that yet
heaved faintly and almost imperceptibly upon
his broad bosom at each long slow-drawn inspiration.</p>

<p>‘He is living?’ Nora asked, in a hushed
voice of painful inquiry; and Marian answered
under her breath, looking up at the bluff doctor:
‘Yes; he’s living still. He’s breathing quite
regularly, though very feebly.’</p>

<p>As for Macfarlane, he went to work at once
with the cool business-like precision and rapidity
of his practised profession, opening the bloodstained
shirt in front, and putting his hand in
through the silk vest to feel the heart that
still beat faintly and evenly. ‘He’s lost a great
deal of blood, no doubt, Mrs Hawthorn,’ he said
cheerily; ‘but he’s a strong man, and he’ll pull
through yet; ye needn’t be too anxious—thanks
to whoever put this handkerchief around his arm.
It’s a good enough tourniquet to use on an
emergency.—Was it you, Miss Dupuy, or Mrs
Hawthorn?’</p>

<p>A round spot of vivid colour flashed for a
moment into Nora’s white cheek as she answered
quietly: ‘It was me, Dr Macfarlane!’ and then
died out again as fast as it had come, when
Macfarlane’s eyes were once more removed from
her burning face.</p>

<p>‘Ye’re a brave lass, and no mistake,’ the
doctor went on, removing the tourniquet, and
stanching the fresh flow rapidly with a proper
bandage, produced with mechanical routine from
his coat pocket. ‘Well, well, don’t be afraid
about him any longer. It’s a big cut, and a
deep cut, and it’s just gone and severed a good
big artery—an ugly business; but ye’ve taken
it in time; and your bandage has been most
judiciously applied; so ye may rest assured
that, with a little nursing, the young man will
soon be all right again, and sound as ever. A
cutlass is a nasty weapon to get a wound from,
because those nigger fellows don’t sharpen them
up to a clean edge, as they ought to do rightly,
but just hack and mutilate a man in the most
outrageous and unbusiness-like manner, instead
of killing him outright like good Christians,
with a neat, sharp, workman-like incision. But
we’ll pull him through—we’ll pull him through
yet, I don’t doubt it. And if he lives, ye may
have the pleasure of knowing, young lady, that
it was the tourniquet ye made so cleverly that
just saved him at the right moment.’</p>

<p>As Macfarlane finished dressing and tending
Harry’s wound, and Harry’s eyes began to open
again, slowly and glassily, for he was very faint
with loss of blood, Nora, now that the excitement
of that awful evening was fairly over,
seemed at last to realise within herself her great
loss with a sudden revulsion. Turning away
passionately from Harry’s bedside, she rushed
into the next room, where the women-servants
were already gathered around their master’s body,
keening and wailing as is their wont, with strange
hymns and incoherent songs, wherein stray scraps
of Hebrew psalms and Christian anthems were
mingled incongruously with weird surviving
reminiscences of African fetichism, and mystic
symbols of aboriginal obeah. Fully awake now
to the blow that had fallen so suddenly upon
her, Nora flung herself in fierce despair by her
father’s side, and kissed the speechless lips two
or three times over with wild remorse in her
fresh agony of distress and isolation. ‘Father,
father!’ she cried aloud, in the self-same long-drawn
wail as the negresses around her, ‘they’ve
killed you, they’ve killed you! my darling—my
darling!’</p>

<p>‘Dem kill you—dem kill you!’ echoed Rose
and Nita and the other women in their wailing
sing-song. ‘But de Lard ob hebben himself
avenge you. De grabe yawnin’ wide this ebenin’
for Louis Delgado. De Lard smite him—de Lard
smite him!’</p>

<p>‘Get away, all you auld crones!’ the doctor
said, coming in upon them suddenly with his
hearty Scotch voice, that seemed to break in
too harshly on the weird solemnity of the ghastly
scene. ‘Let me see how it was they killed
your master. He’s dead, you say—stone-dead,
is he? Let me see—let me see, then.—Here
you, there—lift up his head, will you, and
put it down decently on the pillow!’</p>

<p>Nita did as she was told, mechanically, with
a reproachful glance from her big white-fringed
eyes at the too matter-of-fact and common-sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">{564}</span>
Scotchman, and then sat down again, squatting
upon the floor, moaning and crooning piteously
to herself, as decorum demanded of her under
such circumstances.</p>

<p>The doctor looked closely at the clotted blood
that hung in ugly tangles on the poor old man’s
gray locks, and whistled a little in a dubious
undertone to himself, when he saw the great
gash that ran right across Mr Dupuy’s left
shoulder. ‘An awkward cut,’ he said slowly—‘a
very severe and awkward cut, I don’t deny it.
But I don’t precisely see, myself, why it need
have positively killed him. The loss of blood
needn’t have been so very excessive. He’s
hacked about terribly, poor old gentleman, with
their ugly cutlasses, though hardly enough to
have done for a Dupuy, in my opinion.
They’re very tough subjects indeed to kill, all
the Dupuys are.’</p>

<p>As he spoke, he leant down cautiously over
the body, and listened for a minute or two
attentively with his ear at the heart and lips.
Then he held his finger lightly with close
scrutiny before the motionless nostrils, and shook
his head once or twice in a very solemn and
ominous fashion. ‘It’s a most singular fact,’
he said with slow deliberation, looking over at
Edward, ‘and one full of important psychological
implications, that the members of every nationality
I have ever had to deal with in the
whole course of my professional experience—except
only the Scottish people—have a most
illogical and ridiculous habit of jumping at
conclusions without sufficient data to go upon.
The man’s not dead at all, I tell you—not
a bit of it. He’s breathing still, breathing
visibly.’</p>

<p>Nora leapt up at the word with another
sudden access of wild energy. ‘Breathing!’ she
cried—‘breathing, doctor! Then he’ll live still.
He’ll get better again, will he, my darling?’</p>

<p>‘Now ye’re jumping at conclusions a second
time most unwarrantably,’ Macfarlane answered,
with true Scotch caution. ‘I will not say
positively he’ll get better again, for that’s a
question that rests entirely in the hands of the
Almighty. But I do say the man’s breathing—not
a doubt of it.’</p>

<p>The discovery inspired them all at once with
fresh hope for Mr Dupuy’s safety. In a few
minutes they had taken off his outer clothing
and dressed his wounds; while Nora sat rocking
herself to and fro excitedly in the American
chair, her hands folded tight with interlacing
fingers upon her lap, and her lips trembling
with convulsive jerks, as she moaned in a low
monotone to herself, between suspense and hope,
after all the successive manifold terrors of that
endless evening.</p>

<p>By-and-by the doctor turned to her kindly
and gently. ‘He’ll do,’ he said, in his most
fatherly manner. ‘Go to bed, lass, go to bed,
I tell ye. Why, ye’re bruised and beaten
yourself too, pretty awkwardly! Ye’ll need rest.
Go to bed; an’ he’ll be better, we’ll hope and
trust, to-morrow morning.’</p>

<p>‘I won’t go to bed,’ Nora said firmly, ‘as long
as I don’t know whether he will live or not,
Dr Macfarlane.’</p>

<p>‘Why, my lass, that’ll be a very long watch
for ye, then, indeed, I promise you, for he’ll not
be well again for many a long day yet, I’m
thinking. But he’ll do, I don’t doubt, with
care and nursing. Go to bed, now, for there’ll
be plenty to guard you. Mr Hawthorn and I
will stop here to-night; and there’s neighbours
enough coming up every minute to hold the
place against all the niggers in the whole of
Trinidad. The country’s roused now; the constabulary’s
alive; and the governor’ll be sending
up the military shortly to take care of us while
you’re sleeping. Go to bed at once, there’s a
guid lassie.’</p>

<p>Marian took her quietly by the arm and led
her away, once more half fainting. ‘You’ll stop
with me, dear?’ Nora whispered; and Marian
answered with a kiss: ‘Yes, my darling; I’ll
stop with you as long as you want me.’</p>

<p>‘Wait a minute,’ the good doctor called out
after them. ‘Ye’ll need something to make you
sleep after all this excitement, I take it, ladies.
There’s nothing in the world so much recommended
by the faculty under these conditions
as a good stiff glass of old Highland whisky with
some lime-juice and a lump of sugar in it.—Ye’ll
have some whisky in the house, no doubt, won’t
you, Uncle Ezekiel?’</p>

<p>In a minute or two, Uncle ’Zekiel had brought
the whisky and the glasses and the fruit for the
lime-juice, and Macfarlane had duly concocted
what he considered as a proper dose for the young
ladies. Edward noticed, too, that besides the
whisky, the juice, and the sugar, he poured furtively
into each glass a few drops from a small
phial that he took out unperceived by all the
others from his waistcoat pocket. And as soon as
the two girls had gone off together, the doctor
whispered to him confidentially, with all the air
of a most profound conspirator: ‘The poor creatures
wanted a little sedative to still their
nerves, I consider, after all this unusual and
upsetting excitement, so I’ve just taken the
liberty to give them each a drop or two of
morphia in their whisky, that’ll make them
both sleep as sound as a child till to-morrow
morning.’</p>

<p>But all that night, the negroes watched and
prayed loudly in their own huts with strange
devotions, and the white men and the constables
watched—with more oaths than prayers, after
the white man’s fashion—armed to the teeth
around the open gate of Mr Dupuy’s front

EGYPT.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> those who are interested in ancient Egypt,
and to the student of Biblical archæology, the
last few weeks have given treasures of discovery.
First, there was the unbinding and exposing to
view of the mummies of Ramses II. and III.,
and the identification of that of Queen Nofre-tari;
then the discovery, by Mr Flinders Petrie, of ‘El
Kasr el Bint el Yahudî’ (the Castle of the Jew’s
Daughter), which throws a flood of light upon
the few verses in Jeremiah xliii. where we read
that Johanan, the son of Kareah, followed by
the captains of the forces, the remnant of Judah,
and the Hebrew princesses, daughters of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">{565}</span>
blinded and dethroned Zedekiah, fled to Tahpanhes,
the court of Pharaoh Hophra, king of
Egypt. Lastly, there was the interesting meeting
of the Egyptian Exploration Fund (see
<i>Chambers’s Journal</i>, No. 70), when an account of
the finding of the Greek settlement of Naukratis
was given, and specimens of the treasures found
there were exhibited. To Professor Maspéro we
are indebted for the sight of the celebrated
Pharaohs; and any one travelling in Egypt
should not fail to visit the ‘Hall of the
Mummies,’ in the Boulak Museum, near Cairo,
where, in glass cases, they will see the faces of
these kings exposed to view. First of all, before
describing the appearance of the dead monarchs
as they emerged from the endless folds of the
mummy-cloths, it may be worth while to glance
cursorily at their history.</p>

<p>Ramses II.—the Sesostris of the Greeks—was
the third king of the nineteenth dynasty. He
bears the name of A-naktu, the Conqueror;
and in the rolls of the papyri he is also called
Ses, Sestura, ‘Sethosis—who is called Ramses’—and
Setesu. He was a great builder, and a
warrior as well. The land is filled with his
buildings and with gigantic statues of himself
and his family; and the walls of the temples are
covered all over with vivid pictures of his battles
and victories. Not only in Egypt are these to
be found, but also engraven upon the rock tablets
at Berytus, in Syria, are records of his victories
in Asia. He does not, however, appear to have
allowed his architectural plans and his warlike
expeditions wholly to engross his attention, for
we find him dividing the land into <i>nomes</i> or
provinces, and setting governors over them. He
seems to have employed the prisoners of war in
making canals for the use of those who lived at
a distance from the river. He also rearranged
the scale of rents for land, and made the canal
from the Nile to the Red Sea. In the fifth year
of his reign we find him at Kadesh-on-Orontes,
a fortified Syrian town: war had broken out
with the Khita, a Semitic tribe, who had one
of their strongholds there. After a desperate
struggle, Ramses appears to have been victorious,
and ratified his treaty with the conquered people
by marrying their king’s daughter. We find him
afterwards waging war in Palestine; and it is
certain that he conquered Askelon. He transferred
his court to Sân or Zoan, on the Tanitic
arm of the Nile, and from thenceforth Pi-Ramses
became the seat of government. By many,
Ramses II. is thought to be the Pharaoh of the
oppression, for whom the children of Israel built
the treasure-cities of Pithom and Ramses. Certain
it is that during this reign the literature
and language of Egypt became impregnated with
words borrowed from Semitic sources.</p>

<p>The chief buildings of Ramses II. are the
Ramesseum or Memnonium; a Temple of Victory
at Old Qurnah, dedicated to the god Amon; the
rock-temple of Ipsamboul, dedicated to the chief
gods of Egypt; the completion of the Temple
of Amon at Luxor, which was left unfinished by
Amenhotep III.; and the great hall in the
Temple of Karnak. He erected two giant statues
of himself and two beautiful obelisks, one of
which is in Paris.</p>

<p>The king enjoyed a reign of sixty-seven years;
part of which time he was associated with his
father. He must have been nearly one hundred
years old when he died; and from the temple
walls at Abydos we learn that he had sixty sons
and fifty-nine daughters. This is the merest
outline of Ramses II., one of the greatest of the
Egyptian kings; an essentially successful man,
bold, enterprising, ambitious, and vain.</p>

<p>Now for his personal appearance, in so far as we
can judge of it after its long repose in spices and
linen bandages. For the sake of those whose faith
may not be very strong, let us add that the
mummy was opened by Maspéro and Brügsch—two
of our greatest Egyptologists—in presence
of a large number of people, English as well
as Egyptian, who verified the official statement
made by the high-priest Pinotem on the coffin
lid, and on the outer winding-sheet of the
mummy, that this was in truth the body of
Ramses II. The head is long, and small in proportion
to the size of the body; the top of it is
bald, but otherwise the hair is thick. At the
time of death it was probably white; but the
spices used in the embalmment have turned it
a yellowish colour. The eyebrows, too, are white
and thick; the eyes small and close together;
the temples are sunken; and the nose, long,
thin, and hooked, is also depressed at the tip.
The tightness of the bandaging probably accounts
for this. The chin is prominent, and the jawbone
massive, giving a look of determination to
the face, which is covered with a thin beard and
moustache. The skin is of a brown hue, with
black marks on it, possibly owing to the bituminous
matter used in embalming. The hands,
which are crossed over the breast, are small,
and dyed with henna; the legs and thighs fleshless;
the feet long, slender, and although somewhat
flat-soled, are well shaped. They also are
stained with henna. The body is in a good state
of preservation; and the corpse, which is that of
a very old man, is also that of a strongly built
and vigorous old man. The examination over,
Professor Maspéro returned the mummy to its
glass case, where, with face uncovered, it may
be seen, with the mummies of Pinotem and the
priest Nebsouni.</p>

<p>Ramses III.—surnamed Haq-On—Prince of
Heliopolis, was not the immediate successor of
Ramses II., although he appears to have taken
him for his model. When he came to the throne,
Egypt had degenerated to a miserable condition,
and he first turned his attention to the internal
affairs of the kingdom, rearranging the different
castes and fixing their lines very firmly. He also
started a navy, to trade with the countries near
to Egypt. Many of the trees and shrubs in the
valley of the Nile were planted by him, to
encourage moisture in the atmosphere and give
shade to the people. His buildings were not
nearly so grand or so numerous as those of
Ramses II. He erected several Ramessea and
a new temple at Thebes. He also converted the
treasure-house at Medinet-Abou into a Temple
of Victory, bringing all that was most precious
into it. From some of the papyri, we find that
he was to have been the victim of a plot hatched
in the harem; but it was discovered, and the
conspirators punished. Ramses III. reigned more
than twenty-seven years, and had eighteen sons
and fourteen daughters, to the former of whom
he gave the names of the sons of Ramses II.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">{566}</span>
In his reign, the art of inlaying glass in alabaster
was at its height.</p>

<p>Ramses III. was altogether an inferior man
to his predecessor of the same name, although
probably more intelligent; and from the shape
of the forehead, we might judge him to have
had the intellectual capacities largely developed.
But he was eaten up with vanity, and a desire
to imitate in everything Ramses II. His buildings
are less numerous than that monarch’s;
in style they are far inferior, and the construction
is poor. His wars were chiefly fought close
at home, either with the neighbouring Philistines
or the tribes in the frontier of his country.
This, condensed into a few sentences, is the
outline of his life. In appearance, as seen at
Boulak, when the mummy was uncased, he was
a small man, much inferior in size and build
to Ramses II, although his forehead is of better
proportions. No hair is visible on either face
or head; the cheek-bones are not so high, the
nose not so hooked, the chin and jaw less massive.
Professor Maspéro thinks that the eyes were larger
than those of Ramses II., which were small;
but it is difficult to be certain about this, as
they have been extracted, and the lids even
removed. The mouth is horribly large, and out
of proportion to the rest of the face; the lips
are thin; and many of the teeth are in a perfect
state of preservation. The displaying of the
features of Ramses III. was indeed a proof of
great skill and patience on the part of the operators,
for when the last coverings were removed,
the face was found to be completely hidden by
a coating of bitumen, which had to be taken away
piecemeal with the utmost care. The mummy,
face uncovered, stands now in a glass case by
the side of Ramses II.; and the lid of the
sarcophagus in which he was buried is in the
Museum at Cambridge.</p>

<p>The mummy of Queen Nofre-tari was found
with those of Ramses II. and III. in the hiding-place
at Dayr-el-Bahari; but it became in such
a bad condition, and smelt so horribly, that it
was necessary to get rid of it. Accordingly,
Professor Maspéro decided to open it; and by
doing so, settled a knotty historical question.
Was Nofre-tari, the popular and deeply revered
queen of king Aahmes I. of the eighteenth
dynasty, a negress? On some of the monuments,
she is represented with fine hair and yellow
skin; on others, with a distinctly negro type
of face. Truly, she was worshipped at Thebes
under the form of Hathor, the black goddess
of Death and the nether world. Did, then, the
story of her belonging to one of the black races
of mankind originate in this, or was there real
ground for depicting her with a black complexion?
The investigation of the mummy
answered the question; for although, on being
opened, it began to crumble away and dissolve
into black matter, it was quite possible to ascertain
that she was a woman of full age and
middle height, and that she belonged to the
<i>white</i> races of mankind.</p>

<p>The opening of these mummies was the last
official work of Professor Maspéro, and the
description of them is gathered from his Report.
Unfortunately for all Egyptologists, he has been
obliged to resign his post of Director of the
Excavations and Antiquities in Egypt.</p>

<p>We must now pass on from the interesting Hall
of Mummies, and convey ourselves in thought
to a dismal, dreary corner of the north-eastern
Delta, where, in the neighbourhood of the mounds
of Tell-el-Defenneh, Mr Flinders Petrie has discovered
the remains of the ancient palace in
which Apries Hophra gave shelter to the fugitive
daughters of Zedekiah. This ‘Castle of the Jew’s
Daughter,’ as it is called by the Arabs to-day—the
‘Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes’ of the Bible,
was built by Psammetichus I. Under the corners
of the building, Mr Petrie has dug out
the foundation deposits, consisting of seals, small
tablets, engraved with the king’s name and royal
titles, bricks, &amp;c. It was probably the stronghold
of those Carian and Ionian mercenaries
to whom Psammetichus granted a permanent
settlement at Daphnæ of Pelusium. The building
itself was square, lofty, and of massive structure.
It stands in the remains of a quadrangular
courtyard, the whole covering an area of two
thousand feet in length by one thousand feet
in breadth. Originally, it must have been walled
in, the great boundary wall being fifty feet in
thickness. A gate on the north side opened
towards the canal; another on the south, to
the military road between Egypt, through Palestine,
into Syria. The ‘Kasr’ also possessed a
tower which has probably served at different
times as an outlook, general’s headquarters, and
a royal palace. Nor can we assign one date
only to it; it has been added to at various
times, and to meet the requirements of the different
owners. It is hopeless to conjecture in
how many stories it was originally built; but
the main part of the building contained sixteen
square rooms on each floor, with walls, both outside
and partition, of immense strength. Now,
the basements, which are all that is left, were
the offices of the royal palace, and very interesting
are the discoveries which Mr Petrie has made
there. First of all, there is the kitchen, a big
room with deep recesses in the sides, and containing
a dozen or more large jars, which somehow
have managed to escape the general destruction;
also two flat dishes, three small flat iron
pokers, two corn-rubbers, some weights, and a
large knife made of iron. Then there is a room
which we may suppose to have answered to
the butler’s pantry, for it was evidently the
room where the wine-jars were brought to be
opened; but although there was not one amphora
to be found, there were scores of lids lying
scattered about, many of them stamped with
the cartouches of Psammetichus I., and Necho,
his successor. On a rubbish-heap outside were
found the broken amphoræ, some of them having
the lute-shaped ‘nefer’ written on them in ink, a
mark signifying ‘good.’ There is a tiny chamber
containing a sink; and from the contents of
that sink, it can only have served one purpose,
and that the scullery. Mr Petrie describes it
as being ‘formed of a large jar with the
bottom knocked out, and filled with broken
potsherds placed on edge. The water ran through
this, and thence into more broken pots below,
placed one in another, all bottomless, going down
to the clean sand four or five feet below.’ These
sherds were literally clogged with fish-bones and
animal matter.</p>

<p>Some small tablets engraved with the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">{567}</span>
of Aahmes II., and a bronze seal of Apries, were
also found; and in some of the other rooms were
seen lying about several Greek vases, many
of them well painted with representations of
sphinxes, dancers, chariot-races, harpies, &amp;c.
Amongst the débris, have been picked up amulets,
two rings, a sword handle with wide curved
guard, some scale-armour, beads, seals, &amp;c.; and
several large amphoræ, quite perfect, and a great
many broken ones, although not so badly broken
but that they can be mended. The once stately
building is now a heap of blackened, flame-scorched
ruins, while the ground all round
it is thickly strewn with the débris of its
past treasures. It must have fallen into very
revengeful hands before even it was set on fire,
for it has evidently been ruthlessly knocked to
pieces and dismantled, besides being burnt. Did
the king of Babylon, as is indicated in the
book of Jeremiah, indeed spread his tent on the
hard mud pavement in the square courtyard, and
after giving over ‘such as were for death to
death, and such as were for captivity to captivity,
and such as were for the sword to the sword,’
commence the work of destruction? We cannot
tell: we know that he did come, and that,
according to Babylonian accounts, he conquered.
The Egyptians admit that he came, but say he
was defeated. Anyway, there are three <i>steles</i> in
the Boulak Museum inscribed with his names,
titles, and parentage, which there is every reason
to believe were picked up by the Arabs near
this place. Whether Nebuchadnezzar conquered
or not, ‘Pharaoh’s house at Tahpanhes’ is now
but the wreck of a departed glory.</p>

<p>The recent meeting of the Egyptian Exploration
Fund was particularly interesting. At it,
Mr Ernest Gardner gave a vivid account of
Naukratis, for the excavation of which we are
indebted to Mr Petrie and himself. Naukratis
was an ancient Greek settlement in Lower Egypt,
whose site, until lately, was lost in obscurity.
We know that it contained five celebrated
temples—the Pan-Hellenion, and the temples of
Zeus, Hera, Apollo, and Aphrodite; of these, four
are now discovered. During this present year,
Mr Gardner has found the cemetery of Naukratis.
It is a little distance from the town itself, and,
unfortunately, cannot be wholly excavated, as
there is a modern Arab cemetery exactly over
it. The part already dug out is evidently the
more modern of the two, as it only contains
graves subsequent to the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> From
a strictly antiquarian point of view, it is therefore
the less interesting, although that date gives
the most flourishing period of the history of
Naukratis. There was not one single mummified
body found; the funerals were evidently conducted
strictly after the manner of the Greeks.
Coffins of tile and wood, the latter adorned with
terra-cotta ornaments, were found in the graves;
articles both of use and beauty were found buried
with the dead. In one case, alongside of the
deceased lady’s jewellery, was found her rouge-pot,
still half full of rouge, and beautifully
painted on the outside. Among the many things
found in the town itself is a portrait head of the
time of Berenike II., made in blue porcelain; a
fine archaic statue of Apollo as a hunter, laden
with spoils; and two very fine vases of large
size. The ruins of the Temple of Aphrodite,
built upon the foundations of two earlier ones,
consist of little else than mud walls. In front of
it is the altar, made of the ashes of the victims,
bound together with a mud casing. Thus, after
centuries of burial, has the excavator’s spade
brought us face to face with Naukratis, once the
most flourishing Greek settlement and trading-port
in Lower Egypt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_TALE_OF_TWO_KNAVERIES">A TALE OF TWO KNAVERIES.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="CHAP. I.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.—CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a melancholy and foggy November morning,
and in its yellow gloom that legal byway
known as Southampton Buildings, Holborn,
looked even more frowzy and less respectable
than usual. That, at least, was the opinion of
Mr Blackford, solicitor, who had no love for
the scene of his daily labours, as he turned into
his office at the usual hour, nodded to the
clerk and the office-boy who made up his modest
staff, hung up his hat and coat on their particular
peg, and passing into his private room,
proceeded to open and read the half-dozen letters
which lay on his desk. With one exception,
these were not of a pleasing or cheerful nature.
There was, in the first place, a rather peremptory
reminder that the office rent was overdue, and
must be paid forthwith. Then came a refusal
to ‘settle,’ by the payment of a sum of money,
a doubtful compensation-for-injuries action against
a Railway Company, which Mr Blackford had
undertaken upon the very sporting principle of
charging nothing unless he should succeed; in
which happy event he would retain half the
spoils. Beneath this lay a letter declining to
make an advance on certain dilapidated house-property
belonging to a client, and commenting
sharply on certain alleged misrepresentations;
and then followed two or three more such
epistolary missives.</p>

<p>Mr Blackford’s face wore a very excusable
expression of disgust as he took up the last of
the pile; but he brightened a little as he read
it through. This at anyrate meant ‘business’—above
all, business for which the payment, though
not large or ungrudgingly rendered, would be
certain and prompt. It was signed ‘William
Franklin,’ and it contained a request that Mr
Blackford would call on the writer that day,
in order to take instructions for his will. Now,
William Franklin was the lawyer’s best client;
a retired tradesman of some wealth, and of a
litigious disposition which had for several years
brought as much profit to the business as all
the rest of the connection put together. The
solicitor hastily replied to such of his correspondents
as required that attention, glanced at
his diary, which showed him plenty of leisure
time for the day—a far too usual circumstance
with him; and was preparing to keep Mr
Franklin’s appointment, when his office-boy
knocked and entered.</p>

<p>‘A gentleman to see you, sir.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">{568}</span></p>

<p>‘Who is it?’ asked his master, rather suspiciously.
Unexpected male visitors are not
always welcome to a man whose finances are
shaky.</p>

<p>‘Won’t give his name, sir—says he wants to
see you on particular business. I think it’s a
new client, sir,’ added the boy confidentially,
understanding tolerably well the reasons of his
employer’s hesitation.</p>

<p>‘Oh! Well—show him in; and don’t forget
to hand a chair.’</p>

<p>The visitor entered—a tall, dark, powerful
man, with remarkably bright eyes—well dressed,
as Mr Blackford, drawing comfortable auguries
therefrom, at once observed.</p>

<p>‘Take a seat,’ said the solicitor. ‘What can
I do for you?’</p>

<p>The stranger sat down, glanced uneasily round
the room, went back to the door, opened and
closed it, and returned to his chair. ‘First of
all,’ said he, speaking with the voice and manner
of a gentleman—a voice and manner not too
common among Mr Blackford’s clients—‘I must
apologise for presenting myself in this mysterious
way. I didn’t give my name to your clerk,
for reasons which you will appreciate presently.
It is Willoughby—Charles Willoughby—and here
is my card. I have also a letter of introduction
from my landlord, a client of yours.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder what he’s done?’ was Mr Blackford’s
silent comment as he took the proffered
letter. ‘Forgery, perhaps, or embezzlement. The
last, most likely—if either. I daresay it’s only
a trumpery County Court matter, after all.’</p>

<p>The letter simply stated that Mr Willoughby
had for the last month occupied rooms in the
writer’s house; that he was a very quiet lodger,
and quite the gentleman; that he seemed to
have plenty of money; that he had asked the
writer to recommend a solicitor to him, and
that the writer had at once named Mr Blackford;
from whom, it was added in conclusion,
a fair commission on any profits arising from
the introduction would be expected by his zealous
client.</p>

<p>‘And what can I do for you, sir?’ once more
asked the solicitor, with the increased respect
due to a man who was ‘quite the gentleman’
and ‘seemed to have plenty of money.’</p>

<p>The visitor fixed an anxious look on the
lawyer, and replied: ‘Well, the fact is, Mr
Blackford, that I have of late been greatly worried
and annoyed.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry to hear that. Not very pleasant
in this depressing weather, is it?’</p>

<p>‘It is not, indeed,’ assented the other, with
a spasmodic and mirthless laugh, which began
and ended in a peculiarly sudden manner.</p>

<p>‘What is the nature of the annoyance?’</p>

<p>The visitor was looking round the room in
a bewildered way, and did not seem to hear
the question. On its being repeated, he came
to himself with a start.</p>

<p>‘The annoyance? Oh, it is just this—that I
am being followed about by people who accuse
and threaten me in a most unfounded and
unjustifiable manner.’</p>

<p>‘And of what do they accuse you?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I hardly know, the accusations are so
extremely vague. But they all point to horrible
crimes committed in the past, without particularly
specifying them. The threats are distinct enough:
I am to be utterly ruined by exposure and
denunciation.’</p>

<p>‘Have you ever done anything which would
be likely to give these people a hold on you?
You can be perfectly frank with me, you know;
we lawyers hear a great many curious things,
but we never talk about them. Few men can
say that their lives will bear very close inspection.’</p>

<p>‘I declare to you solemnly that I can reproach
myself with nothing which, if known, would
produce the consequences with which I am
threatened. But you know persistent slander is
sure to make its mark sooner or later; it is
impossible to say what harm may have been done
already.’</p>

<p>‘Who are the people?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know.’ Before giving this unexpected
answer, Willoughby looked down on the floor
and round the room with the same lost and
puzzled air as before.</p>

<p>‘You don’t know who they are!’ said Mr
Blackford with incredulity. ‘That’s rather
strange, isn’t it?—Come, Mr Willoughby; we
are quite alone. Who are they?’</p>

<p>‘I can’t tell you,’ repeated the client; ‘I wish
I could.’ He looked at the lawyer with a
pitiably anxious expression, and beads of perspiration
began to appear on his forehead.</p>

<p>‘When and where do they attack you?’</p>

<p>‘Incessantly and everywhere. I am never safe
from them. Principally at my lodgings, and after
I am in bed at night. They keep me awake
with their outcry.’</p>

<p>Mr Blackford began to be puzzled. His new
acquaintance continued to regard him with the
same eager and helpless look, and wiped his
forehead with a tremulous hand.</p>

<p>‘But—but—bless me,’ said the lawyer, ‘if they
come and annoy you in your lodgings, why don’t
you give them in charge?—How many are there
of them?’</p>

<p>Willoughby shook his head gloomily. ‘They
are too cunning for that,’ he answered. ‘They
are careful to keep out of my sight. I never
set eyes on them; I only hear their voices. And
they are in hundreds—in thousands, for all I can
tell.’</p>

<p>Mr Blackford of course at once understood the
true state of the case, and the discovery was not
a pleasant one. He was by no means a nervous
man, yet he experienced an electrical sensation
in the scalp of his head at the idea that he
was sitting within a yard of an athletic madman.
Clearly, it would not do to contradict so opinionated
a person as this was likely to be; he must be
humoured, and induced, if possible, to go away
quietly.</p>

<p>‘That’s awkward—very awkward,’ said the
solicitor in a reflective tone. ‘If we can’t see
them, you know, how can we get at them so
as to set the law in motion?’</p>

<p>‘I can’t tell what to do,’ said the other despondently;
‘that is why I have come to consult you.
All I know is that they continue to denounce
and threaten me night and day, and that it
cannot go on without being noticed. In that
case, my character will be materially injured, and
they will have attained their object. Besides,
they are killing me, Mr Blackford. A man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">{569}</span>
can’t exist without sleep, and I have had but
little for weeks past. And now I learn that
they are contriving a plan to relieve one another
at night, so as to keep me awake.’</p>

<p>There was something inexpressibly grim in the
earnest yet matter-of-fact way in which these impossibilities
were related; with agitation, indeed,
but with nothing in the nature of abnormal
excitement or maniacal frenzy. He spoke as a
man who found great matter for trouble, but
none for astonishment, in the nightly irruption
into his lodgings of hundreds or thousands of
abusive persons, whose numbers were no hindrance
to their remaining effectually concealed in
the space of two small rooms. But he surveyed
the walls and floor at more frequent intervals in
his dazed manner, as though he suddenly found
himself in a strange place, while his moist and
shaking hands nervously and convulsively worked
his handkerchief into a compact ball.</p>

<p>Actuated at first by the best motives, Mr
Blackford began to question him cautiously as
to his connections and private affairs. It seemed
that, with the exception of some distant relatives
at the Cape, he was alone in the world; nor did
he appear to have any friends in England upon
whom he could rely. Having elicited the further
fact that he had an income of five hundred pounds
a year, derived from funded property, the solicitor
ceased his questions and delivered himself up to
reflection, while his client anxiously awaited the
voice of the oracle.</p>

<p>There are many members of the junior branch
of the legal profession who are of unbending
uprightness and fastidious honour; there are a
few downright knaves; and there are others who
stand neither on the upper nor on the lower
rungs of the moral ladder, but occupy a position
somewhere about the middle. These last are
equally prepared to be honest should honesty be
made easy for them, or rogues in the face of
difficulty or temptation; and among their number
was Mr Blackford. He was not altogether favourably
known to his brother practitioners; but
neither could any definite charge be brought
against him. He had done things which were
certainly worthy of condemnation; but he had
hitherto kept clear of any offence which would
endanger his position on the rolls. He dressed
neatly, he had a good manner and a correct
accent, and he did not drink. His business was
small, and not of a high class, lying mostly among
the smaller sort of tradesmen; yet he had a
certain connection, and even a few clients of
means and fair position; and he was said to
understand his work. He was quite without
capital, and lived a hand-to-mouth life; and he
had certain extravagant tastes of the lower kind.
Money was always scarce with him, and he was
prepared to acquire it in any way which offered,
so that it was unattended with risk; for he was
quite unburdened with scruples, considering all
profit fair which could be safely gained. And
he thought that in this case he saw a chance of
such profit. Willoughby had answered all his
questions, some of them bordering on impertinence,
in the most open and unreserved fashion;
he was evidently disposed to place the fullest
confidence in his legal adviser, looking to him
for sympathy and deliverance. Mr Blackford
felt more at his ease in thus parleying with a
probably dangerous lunatic, than a few minutes
before he would have thought possible.</p>

<p>The upshot of his meditations was that he concluded
to abandon, at all events for the present,
his first very proper and humane purpose of communicating
with the police, and trying to induce
them to deal with the case as that of a lunatic at
large, so that the poor fellow might be properly
cared for until his friends could be communicated
with. For this he substituted a different plan of
action with admirable readiness, and with an
entire absence of pity or compunction. It was
clear that there was money to be made out of
the man by judicious handling; and Mr Blackford
was of opinion that no one could be better
qualified to make it, or more deserving of it
when made, than himself.</p>

<p>He accordingly advised that the threats and
accusations should for the present be treated
with contempt. No doubt they were made for
the purpose of extorting money; any sign that
they were producing an effect would only cause
the annoyance to be redoubled. In the meantime
he, Blackford, would use his wide experience
and not inconsiderable abilities in his client’s
behalf, and had no doubt of the ultimate success
of his endeavours to discover the offenders and
bring them to justice. The poor madman, with
tears in his eyes, thanked him for his kindness
and attention, declared that a load had been
lifted from his mind, and was about to withdraw,
when the solicitor stopped him with an
air of having suddenly recollected something.</p>

<p>‘By the way,’ said he, ‘it’s hardly worth
mentioning—but cases of this nature involve
considerable expense to begin with, in the way
of inquiries and so forth. It is generally the
custom—— Well, to put it plainly, I think I
must ask you for a small present payment on
account; say five pounds or so.’</p>

<p>‘Of course, of course—certainly,’ said the other,
fumbling nervously in his pocket. ‘I am much
obliged to you for mentioning it; this is my first
experience of the kind, I am happy to say. I
have not quite the sum you mention with me at
this moment. Would three pounds ten be enough
for the present? and I will send the rest by
post.’</p>

<p>‘O yes, that will do very well; only a matter
of form, you know,’ said the solicitor carelessly,
but laying an eager grasp upon the coins. ‘I
hope to write to you satisfactorily before long—till
then, good-bye.’</p>

<p>So soon as his new client had left, Mr Blackford
assumed his coat and hat and went off to keep
his appointment with Mr Franklin, who lived
in Camden Town with his married niece and her
husband. As the solicitor strode rapidly along,
he felt a different being from the man who, but
a short half-hour before, had been reading his
letters in so despondent a mood. The sudden
and unwanted accession of business from two
quarters at once on the same day gave him a
feeling of importance; and the consciousness of
the four unexpected gold coins in his pocket
thrilled through him with a comforting glow,
like that of a glass of old ale on a frosty day.
Willoughby, if properly managed, might prove a
small gold mine before his madness should
develop itself to an extent incompatible with
attention to legal matters; and visions arose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">{570}</span>
before him of a possible inquiry <i>de lunatico</i>, with
its expensive accompaniments of the appointment
of a ‘committee’ and the administration of a
nice little estate; all to be conducted, in the
not distant future, to his great pecuniary profit,
by that trustworthy and able man of law, James
Blackford. His castle-building extended to an
important family connection thence to arise; to
the hiring of more commodious offices in a better
situation, necessitated by a rapidly increasing
business; and by the time that he found himself
at the end of his walk, the unpaid rent
and the uncompromised compensation action had
faded in a glow of splendid possibilities.</p>

<p>Mr William Franklin was a tall and gaunt old
man, with a red face, on which dwelt continually
a savage and sardonic smile, framed in a bristling
fringe of silvery-white hair. His character might
almost be summed up in the expressive phrase of
certain of his acquaintance—friends he had none—by
whom it was predicated of him that he was
‘an ugly customer.’ He was, in fact, an evil-tempered
and malicious bully, whose selfish and
tyrannical disposition had been fostered by an
undue consciousness of the twenty-five thousand
pounds which he had made in business, and by
the assiduous court which his wealth caused to
be paid to him by expectant relatives, with all of
whom he took pleasure in quarrelling in turn,
enjoying with a fiendish glee their subsequent
agonies of self-abasement.</p>

<p>‘So, it’s you at last!’ said this amiable old
gentleman, when Mr Blackford was shown into
his presence. ‘Thought you were never coming.
What’s kept you?’</p>

<p>The solicitor, with great humility of manner,
apologised for the unavoidable delay, and alluded
to the overwhelming pressure of business and
the constant calls upon his time.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’m sure—I’m sorry to have put you
about so,’ said Mr Franklin with vast politeness.
‘I couldn’t think of detaining you when you’re
so busy. It’s a matter of no consequence, after
all. Pray, don’t wait; I’ll send to Jones and
Crowder; I daresay <i>they</i> won’t be too much
engaged to come at once.’</p>

<p>Greatly alarmed, Mr Blackford hastened to
protest that his time was entirely at Mr Franklin’s
disposal.</p>

<p>‘Then don’t tell me a pack of lies!’ roared the
client with an instantaneous change of manner,
facing round from the fireplace, poker in hand,
with every apparent intention of committing a
violent assault upon his solicitor. ‘Man alive!
don’t I know that it’s just as much as you can
do to keep body and soul together in that poky
little hole of an office of yours?—<i>Business</i>, indeed!
As if I wasn’t about the only decent client you
have! And why I <i>am</i> your client, goodness only
knows. It’s compassion, I suppose. I always was
too soft-hearted for this world.’</p>

<p>His visitor could have furnished him with a
better reason—namely, that no other lawyer
had ever been found capable of putting up
with his insolence and tyranny. But Mr Blackford
had plenty of self-control, and could bear
a good deal where anything was to be got by
doing so.</p>

<p>The soft-hearted gentleman smote the coals
violently, fulminating subdued anathemas the
while with a dreadful grin. The solicitor, knowing
his man, remained perfectly quiet; and
presently Mr Franklin spoke again, abruptly,
but in a quieter tone.</p>

<p>‘Here! I want to make my will. I’m going
to do it at last—in a fashion that will astonish
some of ’em. They’ve been anxious enough
about it these ten years and more. I hope it’ll
please ’em when it’s done. A set of hungry
hounds! Ready to lick the dirt off my boots
for the money, and nothing too bad to say of
me behind my back. I know it as well as if I
heard it. Not a penny—not a penny for one
of ’em! I’d rather take it into my grave with
me—not but what they’d grub me up again, if
I was in the middle of the earth.’</p>

<p>There was again a short silence. Mr Blackford
awaited his instructions.</p>

<p>‘Then there’s this young Tom Wedlake been
giving me his sauce, just because I spoke a word
to that lazy young baggage of a wife of his—said
he wasn’t going to stand it—<i>he</i> wasn’t going to
stand it—the beggar! and if I didn’t like it, I
could go. <i>Will</i> I! I’ll stay here, just to spite
him. Besides, I’m a deal too comfortable to
move. <i>She</i> won’t let him turn me out—the
artful minx. “Dear uncle—don’t be cross with
me, dear uncle!”’ said Mr Franklin with an
access of fury, and a ludicrous assumption of a
feminine falsetto. “Leave all your money to your
niece, dear uncle; that’s what you’ve got to do.”
Not a brass farthing, by Jove! He doesn’t want
my money, doesn’t he? and he has the impudence
to tell me so! Very good, Mr Thomas Wedlake;
I’ll take you at your word. I’ll pay you out,
you—you—rapscallion!’</p>

<p>The furious monologue seemed to have spun
itself out; so Mr Blackford ventured a word.</p>

<p>‘Then I gather, sir, that you do not intend
to leave any portion of your property to your
nephew and niece—and I have no doubt you are
exercising a sound discretion, as always. But
as you are justly offended with your other
relations, what disposition do you think of
making?’</p>

<p>‘Mind your own business!’ was the unexpected
retort.</p>

<p>Mr Blackford felt rather aggrieved, as the
matter <i>was</i> clearly his business; but he said
nothing. The old man continued his jerky
discourse, addressed more to himself than to
his visitor.</p>

<p>‘You’re right, though.—What shall I do with
it? I’ve been asking myself the same question
ever since I wrote to you last night; and now
you’re here, I’m no nearer the answer. It’s a
deal of money, hard got, and soon spent; and
I don’t know who it’s to go to. Plaguy hard
to leave it at all. No good grumbling about
that, though. I won’t give it to an hospital, or
build a church, or endow almshouses; I’ve no
patience with that sort of humbug. As if a man
hadn’t been robbed enough all these years, what
with rates and what with taxes. I can’t keep
the money myself, and there’s no one to give it
to—no one.’</p>

<p>Perhaps, through that heart, all seared and
scorched with evil passions, eaten through and
through with corroding suspicion, there darted
a momentary pang at the thought that there was
not a human being from whom the gift of all
his painfully acquired wealth would buy one tear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">{571}</span>
of sorrow, or even one grateful remembrance of
the giver.</p>

<p>He sat brooding with a gloomy brow; and
this time the silence was so long that Mr
Blackford was about to break it at the risk of
another rebuke, when Mr Franklin smote his
hand upon his thigh and laughed—a harsh and
cackling laugh, devoid of mirth or geniality.</p>

<p>‘Blackford,’ said he, ‘I’ll leave it to you!’</p>

<p>Had the lawyer received a blow from the ready
poker which stood in the nearest corner of the
fireplace, he could hardly have been more
thoroughly stunned. ‘To me!’ he managed to
gasp out, after a moment’s astounded silence.</p>

<p>‘I’ll leave it to you!’ repeated Mr Franklin,
nodding emphatically. ‘Ain’t you willing, that
you stare like a stuck pig? It’s not because of
any regard for you—don’t think it. I’ll leave
it to you, just because it will be about the worst
kind of sell for ’em all I could anyhow invent.
I hate ’em—every one! and the thought of their
faces when they come to hear the will read, will
be about the only consolation I shall have for
being obliged to part with it at all. And mind
you, I shall make it a condition that they do
hear it read. You are to call them all together
for the purpose, and you’re not to breathe a
word beforehand of the nice little surprise in
store for ’em. Every man-Jack will think he’s
been “remembered”—and so he has, I assure
you! You’ll have a nice time of it with ’em,
Blackford. D’ye quail at the thought of it—eh?
If so, say the word, and we’ll think of something
else.’</p>

<p>‘Not on my account, I beg,’ said the solicitor,
recovering his senses. ‘I daresay I shall be equal
to the occasion. But Mr Franklin, my <i>dear</i> sir,
how am I to thank you for such munifi’——</p>

<p>‘You’d better not thank me at all, if you’re
wise,’ said the eccentric testator; ‘you may sicken
me like the rest, and then I shall alter my mind.
Bosh! I know you well enough. You’ll try to
double the money as soon as you get it; and
you’ll either lose it all and hang yourself, or
you’ll get mixed up in some piece of rascality
that will bring you to penal servitude. You
have my instructions. Go and make the will;
and bring it here to-morrow, and I’ll sign it.
And look here! bring two witnesses with you;
I don’t want any one in this house to know
what I’ve been about. Here’s a list of the
securities. Be off! Good-bye—get out!’ And
with this unceremonious dismissal, the interview
came to an end.</p>

<p>As he hurried back to his office, Mr Blackford
was able at last to realise the immensity of the
good luck which had befallen him in this extraordinary
manner. Twenty-five thousand pounds,
all invested in sound Stock Exchange securities!
Good-bye to the strife for bread; to the trap-net
of petty pecuniary embarrassments which meets
and deadens effort at every struggle; to the
haunting care which makes hard the nightly
pillow and drives away slumber before the dawn;
to the hand-to-mouth existence, and the thousand-and-one
daily degradations of a struggling professional
man. Good-bye to one and all—if Mr
Franklin’s suddenly conceived purpose would but
hold until he should in good time, the best of
time, betake himself to a region where codicils
are an impossibility. But one thought was
present to the lawyer’s mind at that moment—to
get the will drawn and signed with all possible
expedition; but one hope was his—that his client
might thereafter make an edifying end with as
little delay as possible.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AVALANCHES">AVALANCHES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> word avalanche carries with it a sound of
terror and dismay, which may well appal any
mind. Happily, avalanches are unknown in
Great Britain; but in Switzerland they are
sadly too frequent. They are known also under
other names in some parts of Italy and Germany.
Avalanches consist of large accumulations of snow,
set free by some means, descending from an elevated
region to the valley. Their action is more
or less twofold: chiefly by the mass of the snow
sweeping away or overwhelming everything which
comes in its course; but also, sometimes, by so
violently disturbing the air as to cause a hurricane,
which in its destructive force kills men
and cattle, and tears up trees and even houses
from their solid foundations.</p>

<p>Avalanches have been divided into four classes.
There are powdery avalanches, in which the
snow and ice break up into powder, forming a
kind of silver cloud, sparkling like quicksilver,
and making a noise like distant thunder. This
kind is more dangerous by reason of the commotion
produced in the air, than by its weight
or power to overwhelm. There are what are
called creeping avalanches. The mass of snow,
being disengaged, moves down a more gentle
slope, as on an inclined plane, and so is sluggish
in its course. Then there is the glacier avalanche,
which consists of a large mass of ice detached
from the glacier above, which descends to the
valley. This is the least dangerous kind, and
is more common in summer. Lastly, there is
the avalanche proper, which is the most dangerous
of all, and consists of vast accumulations
of snow set free from above, which increase in
force as they descend, overthrowing houses, tearing
up trees, burying villages, and swallowing up
forests, cattle, and human beings. Sometimes,
however, an avalanche may change its character
in its descent; as, for instance, a creeping avalanche
may reach a steep declivity, and the mass
of snow falling on the sharp angles of a rock,
it may be shattered, and its mass dispersed in
a cloud of powdery snow. Cases occur sometimes
in which, instead of burying the objects with
which they come in contact, they drive them
into the valley, and deposit them at a considerable
distance from their original position. A
remarkable case of this kind occurred in 1806;
an avalanche which fell in the Val Calanca, transferred
an entire forest to the other side of the
valley, and planted a fir-tree on the roof of the
rector’s house!</p>

<p>An instance may be given of the effects of a
powdery avalanche which occurred in the Oberland,
in the canton of Berne. It was on the 12th
of December 1808, about six o’clock, that the
avalanche descended on the village of Shärmatt,
sweeping away three houses, and carrying one
of them fully three hundred yards, and some
portions of it more than half a mile. In one
house two persons were smothered by the snow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">{572}</span>
and five in the other. The third house contained
six children and their uncle. Some of
the children were in bed, and the rest were sitting
at a table learning their catechism. All at once
the light was put out, a thick darkness surrounded
them, they felt themselves enveloped in
snow, and whirled along they knew not whither.
Presently a deep ditch stopped the progress of
the house. The uncle, soon recovering his
presence of mind, began to grope about the
snow for the children. After a long search, he
found them—all alive, and not seriously injured.
He took them to a barn near by, where they
were obliged to spend the remainder of the night,
some of them almost naked, though the cold was
intense. The father of the children was engaged
with his cows at a shed at some distance, and
was horror-struck, when he returned to where
his house had stood, to find it gone—swallowed
up, as he supposed, with the whole of his family.
But his fears were soon exchanged for joy; and
the sight of the meeting of the father and his
children and brother affected the roughest of the
bystanders to tears.</p>

<p>On the same evening, a second avalanche fell,
and was fatal to the inhabitants of another house.
The only living thing which survived was a
little dog which had taken refuge in the cellar.
As soon as the ruins of the house were removed,
he jumped out of his hiding-place, barking at
the workmen.</p>

<p>In this case was an instance of the hurricane
produced by the agitation of the air by means of
the descending cloud of powdery snow. Several
cattle-houses, with the cattle, were torn from
the ground and driven like chaff before the
wind. There was also another instance of the
wonderful power of the hurricane in the case
of a barn full of hay, which was carried more
than a quarter of a mile, and deposited on the
opposite side of the river in its right position,
with its contents uninjured!</p>

<p>It has sometimes happened that the snow has
not fallen to a sufficient thickness to crush the
houses, in which event the inmates have more
chance of being saved, as the porous character of
the powdered snow allows of sufficient air to
sustain respiration. This was the case when,
in 1749, the entire village of Tauetsch, in the
Grisons, was one night overwhelmed by a powdery
avalanche, which descended so noiselessly that the
inhabitants were not aware of the calamity, and
wondered in the morning why the day did not
break. One hundred persons were covered in
by the snow in their houses, sixty of whom were
got out unhurt.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most remarkable instance of
imprisonment in the snow of a descending avalanche
occurred in the hamlet of Bergoletto, in
the valley of the Upper Stura, at the foot of
the Alps, near the fortress of Demonte, in Piedmont.
Three persons survived an incarceration
of five weeks. It was in the winter of 1755,
when the falls of snow had been so very heavy
that there was danger that its weight would
break through the roofs of the houses. On the
19th of March, therefore, some of the people
tried to avoid the danger by removing the snow
from their house-tops. Among those so engaged
were a man named Roccia, and his son, a lad
of fifteen. The village clergyman was at this
time leaving his house for his church, when he
saw two avalanches descending. Calling to Roccia
and his son, he returned speedily to his own
dwelling. Father and son instantly fled towards
the church. They had not run more than forty
yards when the lad fell close behind his father,
who, turning round to assist his son, was seized
with horror on seeing that his own house and
the houses of his neighbours were buried beneath
an enormous pile of snow. His earthly all was
swallowed up—his wife, his sister, his children,
gone! The shock overcame him, and he fainted.
His son soon recovered himself, and helped his
father to the house of a friend; but he was five
days before he was sufficiently restored to make
any exertions in seeking his lost ones. Thirty
houses were destroyed, and twenty-two persons
were missing, among them the clergyman who
gave the alarm. The snow lay over the village
to a depth of more than forty feet, and extended
its destruction some ninety yards in length by
twenty broad.</p>

<p>The news of the disaster brought more than
three hundred men from the neighbouring valleys.
With iron rods, they sought to discover where
the houses were; and then they commenced digging
vigorously; but the depth of snow was so great
(another heavy fall coming on) that they could
make little or no progress, and were compelled
to desist, after toiling for several days. No hope
could they entertain of any one being preserved
alive; and as the warm winds were expected to
set in in less than a month, they resolved to
wait until the mass should be partly melted.</p>

<p>On the 18th of April the men returned to their
sad task. Roccia was among the most active of
the workers. Though he had no hope that he
should ever see any of his dear family alive,
yet he laboured diligently, assisted by his son
and a brother-in-law. After six days they
advanced so far, that by breaking through two
yards of ice they could touch the ground with
a long pole. On the following day they were
joined by another brother of his wife, who had
been led to come and assist by a dream which
he had, in which he saw his sister alive, begging
of him to help her. Setting to work with new
vigour, the four rescuers made their way into
Roccia’s house—but it was silent and tenantless.
Thinking that those they sought might have
taken refuge in a stable which stood in a
sheltered position some thirty yards from the
house, they renewed their energies in that direction.
After burrowing through the snow for
some time, one of them thrust a pole through
an opening. On withdrawing it, they heard a
faint voice say: ‘Help, dear husband! help, dear
brother!’ They now worked away with redoubled
industry, and soon made a considerable opening,
through which one of the brothers descended.
The spot was totally dark, and he could see
no one. ‘Any one here?’ he cried. His sister
answered in trembling and broken accents: ‘It
is I, dear brother. My sister-in-law and my
daughter are alive too. I have always trusted
in God that He would send me relief, and He
has been graciously pleased to preserve me and
deliver me.’</p>

<p>Her husband and other brother also descended;
and there were joy and tears and thankfulness
beyond expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">{573}</span></p>

<p>The imprisoned women were too weak to move,
and were shrunk almost to skeletons. With
great tenderness they were removed to the house
of a friend, where they were put to bed and
nursed with care and affection. The daughter
recovered soonest, and the unmarried woman
was able to walk in a week or two; but Roccia’s
wife, who had been in a more cramped position
than the rest, was the last to regain the use of
her limbs; and her eyes were ever afterwards
affected with dimness, from being suddenly brought
out of her prison into the light of day.</p>

<p>We give a description of their imprisonment
from the lips of Roccia’s wife. When the dire
calamity befell them, she was in the stable with
her sister. They had gone there with some
rye-flour gruel for one of the goats which, on
the evening before, had brought forth two dead
kids. Roccia’s daughter and a younger son were
with the women, standing in a corner among the
animals, waiting for the sound of the bell to go
to church. In the stable were a donkey, six
goats, and half-a-dozen fowls. Roccia’s wife was
about to leave the stable to go to her own house.
Scarcely had she reached the stable door, when
she heard the warning voice of the minister.
Looking up, she saw the descending avalanche,
and heard a sound as of another at some little
distance. She hurried back into the stable and
told her sister and her children. In a few
minutes the snow descended upon the building,
crashing in the roof and part of the ceiling. To
save themselves they got into the rack and
manger, the latter being under the main posts
of the building, and therefore able to bear the
immense pressure. They occupied, however, a
very uncomfortable posture, crouching against the
wall in a space only a little more than a yard
in breadth. They had escaped instant death, but
the more painful and lingering death by famine
seemed certainly to await them. They were
oppressed with the thought of how they could
subsist under such circumstances. The children
did not lose heart; they said they had had
breakfast, and could do very well until the next
morning. The aunt had a few chestnuts in her
pocket; and two each of these served for their
supper, with snow-water as a beverage. In the
bakehouse near the stable was the whole produce
of yesterday’s baking. They made repeated
attempts to force their way through the snow
to the bakehouse, but all in vain. There was
only one resource left, and that was the goat
which had recently brought forth the two dead
kids. This supply proved invaluable. On the
second day they felt the pangs of hunger; they
divided the remaining chestnuts among them, and
also a quart of goat’s milk. The third day they
made another effort to get to the bakehouse;
but the weight of snow was too much for them,
so they gave up all hopes of help from that
direction. They were therefore shut up to the
milk of the one goat.</p>

<p>To feed the goats was now one great object.
Two of them were near the manger—the one
already yielding milk; and the other, being with
young, might be expected soon to do so, if they
could only supply them with food. Over the
manger where they lay was a hole into the
hayloft; through this hole they pulled down the
fodder into the rack; and when they could no
longer reach it, the sagacious creatures climbed
upon their shoulders and helped themselves.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week, the boy began
to sink. He had complained of great pain in
his stomach. His mother nursed him in her lap
for a whole week, when he desired to lie his
length in the manger. His hands and lips were
cold, and his respiration feeble. His mother put
a little milk to his lips, but he could not take
it; and then with one tender cry, ‘O my father
in the snow! O father, father!’ he expired.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of their imprisonment
they were in total darkness. For nearly three
weeks the crowing of the cock enabled them to
distinguish night from day; but at the end of
this term chanticleer died, and his companions
followed him one by one. They then literally
took ‘no note of time.’ The donkey and the
other goats were very restless for some time,
but at length they fell a prey to hunger and
exhaustion. The milk of the first goat gradually
diminished; but the kidding of the second
increased the supply, and as they killed the
kid, though with great reluctance, the supply
held out until the day of their deliverance. The
poor goat became quite a solace to them, as it
was so tame as to lick their hands and face. The
poor creature was ever afterwards an object of
great affection in the family.</p>

<p>We need only add one or two interesting facts.
During their five weeks’ imprisonment they suffered
little uneasiness from hunger after the first
week. The effluvia from the dead animals were
far more disagreeable, as also the vermin which
infested the place, and the great coldness of the
snow-water which trickled over them. The constrained
position was also a source of great misery.
During the whole of the time, Mrs Roccia had
no sleep; but her daughter and her sister had
intervals of repose equal to their nightly rest.
Their deliverance was a matter of great thankfulness
to all concerned; and many a winter’s
evening was spent in relating around their
humble hearth the sufferings, the mercies, and
the deliverance of that eventful time.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_NIGHT_IN_AN_INDIAN_HILL-FORT">A NIGHT IN AN INDIAN HILL-FORT.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> short time ago, I being then an insignificant
member of the Army Headquarters staff
at Simla, the hill-capital of India, it became
desirable to increase the number of hill-stations
for the summer accommodation of British troops.
It was thought that the Chor mountain, the
most prominent peak of which is some sixty
miles from Simla, would on its lower ridges
afford suitable sites; and accordingly, a Committee
of officers was formed for the purpose
of reconnoitring and making a report. This
Committee consisted of a well-known general,
a major of Engineers, and myself, a humble sub.
Somewhat trying work it was to get to the Chor,
the road being of the most breakneck description,
and the monsoon rains showing symptoms
of bursting for our especial delectation. However,
we trudged on manfully, climbed to the very
topmost peak of the Chor, which by our aneroid
we made over twelve thousand feet, and saw—nothing;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">{574}</span>
for, by evil chance, one of the most
magnificent views in Asia was barred to us by
clouds which shut out everything except the
first mile or two of the hog-backed ridges
below us. Disappointed, we descended; and that
night it was arranged we should separate and
return to Simla by different routes, so as to
make the President’s report as comprehensive
as possible. In the execution of this idea, I
found myself the next day at a place called
Bhairogh, whence I proceeded—on foot, for we
had been obliged to send our ponies back, owing
to the state of the road—to a village called Tali.
Here at first I thought of camping, as I had
come some eleven miles up hill and down dale;
but the place was so bare and I was so anxious
to push on, being short of provisions, that I
suddenly determined to double my march and
make for a fort called Rajgarh, and described as
being some twelve miles farther on. Unfortunately,
I was dilatory in starting; the march,
as usual, was longer than I had been led to
suppose; the road was hilly, and it was not
until about nine <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> that I found myself peering
through the darkness in the vicinity of my
destined camp.</p>

<p>Camp, did I say? It was very soon evident
that there was to be no camp for me that evening,
and, what was still more objectionable, no supper.
Slowly as I had walked, my servant with whom
was all my money, and the coolies with my tent
and kit, were miles behind. It was too late for
such an unkempt ragamuffin as I undoubtedly
was to disturb the garrison, so I shortly made
up my mind to bivouac peacefully under a tree.
Just outside the fort, however, and close to the
spot I had marked out for my resting-place,
two natives, by the light of a fire, were hammering
some metal vessel with such animation as to
wholly preclude the possibility of sleep. To
these enthusiasts I explained that I was a sahib,
and suggested they should postpone their operations
till next morning. They, naturally enough
perhaps, demurred; and I wrangled, and they
continued their metallic fantasia until I could
stand it no longer. Thinking, perhaps, I could
persuade the local head-man to assist me in
getting a night’s rest, I presented myself at
the gate of the fort, a square walled inclosure
of no strength, and demanded admittance. After
much palavering with the sleepy sentry, I was
let in past the outer wall, but not into the
inner part; whereupon, I asked that the head-man
should be sent for, and further clamoured
for a chair. Seated upon this, and curiously
scrutinised by a few promiscuous hill-folk, I
waited for some five minutes, wondering why
nobody came. At last a gate in the inner wall
was thrown open, and out poured a procession,
lit with torches, and headed by an evidently
high-class native in flowing white robes. After
the interchange of salaams, this individual, who
subsequently turned out to be the tehsildar
(administrator of a district), said to me with
much humility: ‘Is your honour sent by the
government to see if troops can be encamped
on our hills?’</p>

<p>I admitted the soft impeachment; whereupon
the tehsildar smiled benignly, and a succession
of happy grunts and ‘It is <i>hes</i>,’ ran round the
rest of the assembly, who had grouped themselves
in an admiring circle round my chair.</p>

<p>‘Ah, your honour, we are made very happy
by seeing you! The Deputy Commissioner of
Simla wrote to our rajah to say that you and
two other sahibs were coming; but we feared
you had gone by another way.’</p>

<p>This was gratifying, but not to the purpose.
I accordingly explained to my friend my situation,
begged him to discourage the metal-workers,
and asked that my servants when they arrived
might be directed to my whereabouts. At this,
consternation reigned on every side, and the
tehsildar nearly fainted.</p>

<p>‘Your honour sleep under a tree!’ he gasped.
‘It is not to be thought of. I have given
orders for a banquet to be prepared for your
honour; and your sleeping-room is by this time
ready. Will your honour be pleased to come
and see it?’</p>

<p>I followed the obsequious tehsildar, and
inspected my proposed sleeping apartment, a
small room, with no outlet but the door, and
literally stuffed with carpets, quilts, and pillows,
evidently collected, hurriedly for the occasion.
What pleased me most was the sight of a bed,
which I at once ordered to be brought out into
a sort of inner veranda, not wishing to be
wholly suffocated. I then did justice to the
‘banquet’ as a man who had trudged some five-and-twenty
miles over a difficult country might
reasonably be expected to do. The surroundings
were rather oppressive, and the civilities of my
host and his companions rather overwhelming;
but I was not in a mood to be critical, and it
was with considerable self-satisfaction I eventually
sought my couch, falling asleep almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>The next morning, I prepared to start on
another march, and again I had an interview
with the tehsildar and the rest of the garrison.
I could not help noticing that though the man
was perfectly polite and obliging, there was a
change in his demeanour and in that of his
following. No more was my every movement
watched with eager curiosity, no more was my
every mouthful accompanied by beaming smiles
and grunts of satisfaction. This did not distress
me greatly, but I thought it curious, and when
I had said farewell and had fairly started on
my journey, I asked my servant what it all
meant.</p>

<p>The man smiled, and explained: ‘Deputy
Commissioner Sahib he write to rajah this place
and say: “Very great general and two other
sahibs coming see your country. Government
want put soldiers in your country when hot
time comes. Good for you if government do
this, because government pay you well, and
country getting plenty rich.” Rajah he very
pleased, and write to all his tehsildars and say:
“When great general sahib comes, you make
plenty show and big dinner.” Last night you
come to fort, and it rather dark; tehsildar he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">{575}</span>
not see very well, and he think you be very
great general. This morning come, he see you
not general, and he plenty sorry such big dinner
make!’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHAT_GOES_TO_THE_MAKING_OF_A">WHAT GOES TO THE MAKING OF A
SILK GOWN.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Visitors</span> to the International Exhibition at Edinburgh
who have watched with wonder and admiration
the deft fingers of the silk-winder as she
winds the delicate straw-coloured threads from
the cocoon, may be interested to know something
of the rise and progress of the manufacture of
this, the most beautiful and costly of all our
textile fabrics.</p>

<p>The spinning of silk was first discovered in
China, and is supposed to have been practised
there almost two thousand eight hundred years
before the birth of Christ. A Chinese empress,
See-ling, a native of India, is said to have
discovered, probably by accident, that those
wonderful cocoons which the silkworm prepares
for its transformation might be pressed into the
service of man in the same way as cotton and
flax are. She unravelled the delicate fibres, and
found them to be strong, though fine, and capable
of being woven into a web. Prosecuting her
researches, she learned how to breed and rear
the worms so as to obtain an abundant supply
of cocoons; and in this way initiated a new
industry, which the empresses who succeeded her
delighted to foster.</p>

<p>For a long time the weaving of silk was in
the hands of the court ladies; then, by slow
degrees, it passed from rank to rank, until it
became the favourite occupation of all classes of
women. It was introduced into Europe by way
of Constantinople; and in 527 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, in the reign
of Justinian, it had become so far common that
garments of silk were the favourite wear of the
Byzantine nobles. The origin and manufacture
of this beautiful fabric seem, however, to have
been very imperfectly understood, until two
monks who had travelled through India and
China astonished the emperor and his court
by informing them that the shining silk garments
which they admired so much owed their
existence in the first place to the labours of a
small worm. Justinian, like many crowned heads,
was often in want of money, and it occurred to
him, as he listened to the travellers’ wonderful
tales, that if he could introduce the manufacture
of this costly cloth into his dominions, it would
be a sure and increasing source of revenue. Thus
judging, he offered the two monks a large reward
if they would procure for him a supply of the
eggs of this wonderful creature. The monks
undertook the commission; and after much difficulty,
succeeded in procuring a few ounces of
the eggs of the silkworm moth. This treasure,
which they had not obtained without danger,
they hid in two hollow canes which they used
as staffs. One of these precious staffs was lost;
but the other was safely presented to Justinian;
and the supply of eggs so curiously procured laid
the foundation of a flourishing silk-manufacture.</p>

<p>This, which was at first a close monopoly,
guarded with the most jealous care, gradually
became extended to other countries, as wave after
wave of conquest swept over the Eastern Empire.
One of these conquerors, Roger, king of Sicily,
in 1140 transported a whole colony of silk-weavers,
with a plentiful supply of eggs, from
Constantinople to Palermo, where, for many
centuries afterwards, a great manufacture of silk
flourished. It was not until nearly a hundred
years after the Sicilian king’s invasion of Constantinople
that the enterprising citizens of
Genoa and Venice succeeded in procuring a supply
of the coveted eggs, and very soon made their
countries famous for the manufacture of silk.
In 1300, the velvets of Genoa were renowned
throughout Europe; but there was always an
attempt, more or less, to make the manufacture
of silk a monopoly; and it was not until nearly
two hundred years after the Italian cities had
become famous centres of the silk industry, that
the manufacture was introduced into France.
When it did come, it was, as in the case of
Roger of Sicily, in the train of a conqueror.
Francis I., while pursuing his conquests in the
north of Italy, became aware of the wealth and
importance of this branch of industry, and succeeded,
partly by bribery, partly by force, in planting
colonies of silk-weavers in Lyons, Avignon,
and Tours. In all these cities it flourished greatly
in a short time, particularly in Lyons, which
speedily became one of the centres of the silk-manufacture
throughout Europe.</p>

<p>In England, James I. made an effort to introduce
it; but, in spite of his fostering care, it
did not at first take kindly to the soil, and,
in fact, never throve until it was re-introduced
by the Huguenot refugees who were driven
from France by the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes. Under their care it became for a
short time very prosperous, and England bade
fair to rival either Italy or France; but the trade
was from the first a close monopoly, from which
all outsiders, either foreigners or natives, were
jealously excluded. The consequence of this was
that there was no improvement; the manufacture
stood still in England, while in France it was
making gigantic strides. It was in vain that successive
acts of parliament were enacted to foster
and encourage it; it continued to decline until
1824, when it was at last freed from the swaddling
bands which had so long impeded all free growth
and progress. It has, however, been found impossible
to recover as yet our lost ground, and the
great proportion of the silk used in this country
still comes from France. In the year 1877, our
import of silk amounted to £12,631,822, of which
by far the greater amount came from France.
France, indeed, at this moment far surpasses, in
the production of silk, any other country in the
world, the annual value of this manufacture
being about thirty millions. Many causes have
been at work in France to produce this result,
one of which is undoubtedly the attention paid
to technical education, and the extent to which
it is taken advantage of by both men and
women.</p>

<p>There are two distinct systems under which,
across the Channel, this important manufacture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">{576}</span>
is carried on. Around Lyons, the trade is in
the hands of small practical manufacturers, who
have risen by dint of industry and skill from
the ranks of workmen. These men set up in
business for themselves, but not in any large
way; they do not employ many hands, and often
themselves work harder than any of their assistants.
These hands, both male and female—for
women are employed as largely as men—can
and do receive instruction at a very cheap rate,
and from the best masters, at one or other of the
Ecoles de Théorie of Lyons. There the whole
process and the best modes of silk manufacture
are exhaustively taught. Chemistry and the
arts of colouring silk, with the drawing and
designing of patterns, are included in the lessons.
This system of small manufacturers, who board
in their own families the apprentices whom they
train to their trade, was once general throughout
France; but within the last fifty years it has
in many districts been superseded by another,
known as the Convent Factory system. It
sprang up first among the Jura Mountains at
the small village of Jujurieux. A native of the
village, a poor lad, had worked at Lyons as an
apprentice in the establishment of one of the small
master manufacturers so common there. By dint
of industry and intelligence, Jean Bonnet soon
became a master himself, and entering into contracts
with important Parisian houses, in course of
time accumulated a large fortune. Returning to
his native place, he found it as he had left it,
ugly, decaying, and wretchedly poor, and resolved
to raise it to prosperity. He began by buying
a large piece of ground, on which he built a
number of pretty cottages, a handsome church,
and finally a large factory, in which he resolved
to employ only women. He fed, lodged, and
clothed the poor girls whom he received into
his employment, paid them small wages, and
taught them the art of silk-weaving along with
the rudiments of education. At the beginning
of his enterprise, he had many difficulties to
contend with; his pupils in the first instance
often preferred the rough work of the fields;
but he persevered with his experiment until he
had conquered all obstacles, and made Jujurieux
prosperous, and his system a success. The girls,
the native material out of which he formed his
workwomen, became, by the aid of a select body
of nuns whom he had enlisted in his service,
famous throughout France for their good conduct
and respectability.</p>

<p>The success of this first convent factory led
to the establishment of many others, which with
varying fortunes still continue to be worked very
much on the same principle. Not all were so
successful as that of Jujurieux; but many have
been so to a great degree, and there are now
three large factories conducted on this principle
in the south of France. Sometimes nuns are
employed as teachers, but not invariably so; in
many instances their place is taken by female
superintendents expert at the trade. These
women, like the small master manufacturers,
often display the kindliest interest in those
under their charge; and if they see a girl exceptionally
clever and intelligent, will make no
inconsiderable personal sacrifices to enable her
to perfect herself in the higher branches of the
industry by becoming a designer of new materials,
of patterns, and combinations of colour,
such as are rigidly demanded with every successive
season by the uncompromising tyranny
of Fashion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak smalltext" id="THE_GREAT_SHIP-CANAL_OF_CORINTH">THE GREAT SHIP-CANAL OF CORINTH.</h2>
</div>


<p>This work, which, cutting through the Isthmus
of Corinth, will be of sufficient depth and width
to allow of the passage of large vessels, is making
rapid progress, employing at present about one
thousand men. The quantity of earth to be
excavated will be about twelve million cubic feet,
and of this, about two and a half millions have
already been removed. The depth of the canal
is proposed to be twenty-six feet; and the width
at the surface of the water will be seventy-two
feet, except at the entrance, where it will be
about three times that width. The water is
already admitted to a distance of sixteen hundred
feet into the land at each end, the depth being
nearly seventeen feet. It is confidently estimated
that the canal will be accomplished in about
five years from the present time, judging by the
rate at which it is being carried on. It will
be an eminently useful work when completed,
and one calculated to save much valuable time,
by enabling ships to go through the Isthmus,
instead of having to sail round the Morea in
order to pass from east to west, or from west
to east—a circumstance that must carry its own
importance in the commercial and maritime
world.</p>
